# File Generator

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to File Generator, this is a mono-repo project that generates files for you! Currently in the form of a VS Code extension, but in future who knows where it will end up.

## Development

-   @file-generator/core - The core of the extension, this is where the magic happens.
-   vscode/\* - The glue between the extension and VS Code.
    -   vscode/rmg - React Module Generator, this creates React components from a template.
