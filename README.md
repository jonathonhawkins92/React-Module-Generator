# What is React Module Generator (RMG)

RMG was created when I got bored of creating a folder, creating a barrel file and then creating a component file aka a module, so this is a kind of file snippet.

## Features

Create modules, what is a module? A module is a self contained component that exposes it's components via a barrel (index) file, which makes it clear which parts of that folder are ready for consumption, think of everything in the barrel file as a public resource!

## Extension Settings

-   `rmg.typescript`: Enable/disable TypeScript file generation.
-   `rmg.fileExtensions`: Enable/disable file extension in barrel files export.
-   `rmg.includeStyle`: Enable/disable the addition of a style file and importing of said file in component.
-   `rmg.includeTranslation`: Enable/disable the addition of a translation file and importing of said file in component.
-   `rmg.defaultImports`: Any and all imports needed in your module, if you want to disable this set it to an empty array.
-   `rmg.exportType`: What type of export you want to use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export.
-   `rmg.rootDirectory`: The location that we will create your new module in via the command pallet, without this we will attempt to fallback to the workspace root.
